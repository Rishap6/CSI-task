# 🔥 Enigma 3.0 – Landing Page for CSI-SIES GST

Welcome to the official landing page for **Enigma 3.0**, the flagship technical fest of **CSI-SIES GST**.  
This project was designed and developed by me, **Rishikesh Mudaliyar**, as a clean, interactive, and responsive web experience to reflect the spirit of the fest — **creativity, tech, and community**.

## 📌 About This Project

I wanted to build something beyond the usual static pages — something that feels alive, engaging, and fun to scroll through. Inspired by futuristic tech vibes, glitch effects, particles, and neon-glow boxes, this landing page captures what Enigma is all about: **bold ideas, youthful energy, and a passion for innovation**.
